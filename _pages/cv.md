## Education

* **BSc in Computer Science** - University of Bern, 2015  
  With minors in Mathematics (60 ECTS) and Physics (30 ECTS) – *magna cum laude*  
  **_Thesis Title:_** A Study of 3D Deformable Parts Models for Detection and Pose-Estimation
  
* **MSc in Computer Science** - University of Bern, 2017  
  With specialization in Advanced Information Processing – *summa cum laude*  
  **_Thesis Title:_** From Cartoons to Real Images: An Approach to Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning
  
* **PhD in Computer Science** - University of Bern, 2017-present  
  **_Topics:_** Unsupervised learning methods with a focus on self-supervised feature learning

## Professional Experience

* **Junior Data Analyst** - Philip Morris International, 2016  
  I developed a Matlab tool for the automatic analysis of ciliary beating movies. The tool allows the extraction of key endpoints such as tissue activity and main beating frequencies with a higher accuracy compared to previous methods. By tracking tissue patches over different videos it also allows the analysis of regions over a longer period of time.

* **Software Engineering Intern** - AdNovum, 2015  
  I worked on a mobile payment app, implementing several parts of the iOS version of the app in Objective-C. My main responsibilities were: Feature implementation, bug-fixing and Proof of Concept. The work took place in large teams and was managed with Scrum and the use of tools such as Jira and Confluence.

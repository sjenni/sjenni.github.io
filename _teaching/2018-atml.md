I am a teaching assistant in this introductory deep learning course. 


Course Description
======
This course provides an introduction to deep learning methods. These are modern methods in artificial intelligence (AI), which are incorporated into most of the top-performing algorithms in several fields of research. The focus is on the machine learning paradigm, where rules are learned from examples, rather than being hard-coded. Most examples cover the field of computer vision, that is, problems of object recognition, detection, segmentation in images and videos.

School Description
======
Due to increased access to data and compute capacity Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence have become useful in many areas. 
In research and industry it is applied in various fields. 
Image recognition, online discrimination, natural language treatment, robotics, omics ... you name it. 

In this winter school on machine learning you attend lectures and tutorial sessions over four mornings. 
This happens in Muerren, a great ski resort, in the cool old hotel Regina.
